      Hi! I'm Eric, a 22-year-old software engineer living in the Bay Area, currently an intern at Arsenal Biosciences.

      I'm a soon-to-be graduate at University of California, Santa Cruz, pursuing a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science.

      I'm passionate about working on meaningful projects where I can apply my skills to solve impactful, real-world problems. My interests lie in distributed systems, building scalable backend architecture, and robotics. I specialize in development using Python and C++, and have a strong foundation in object-orientated programming and database systems.
